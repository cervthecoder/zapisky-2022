It is odd, but on the infrequent occasions when I have been called upon in a formal place to play the bongo drums,

 the introducer never seems to find it necessary to mention that I also do theoretical physics.

 I believe that is probably because we respect the arts more than the sciences.

 The artists of the Renaissance said that man's main concern should be for man,

 and yet there are other things of interest in the ,world.

 Even the artists appreciate sunsets, and the ocean waves,

 and the march of the stars across the heavens.

 There is then some reason to talk of other things sometimes.

 As we look into these things we get an aesthetic pleasure from them directly on observation.

 There is also a rhythm and a pattern between the phenomena of nature which is not apparent to the eye,

 but only to the eye of analysis;

 and it is these rhythms and patterns which we call Physical Laws.

 What I want to discuss in this series of lectures is the general characteristic of these Physical Laws;

 that is another level, if you will, of higher generality over the laws themselves.

 Really what I am considering is nature as seen as a result of detailed analysis,

 but mainly I wish to speak about only the most overall general qualities of nature.
